# Enclave Smart Balance v0 Implementation

## Overview

The v0 implementation of enclave-smart-balance is designed as a simplified, centralized setup to demonstrate core functionality and user experience.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Single Paymaster, Single Solver**
   - Utilizes a centralized architecture with one paymaster and one solver.

2. **Trusted Settlement**
   - Sponsors user intents on the destination chain.
   - Settles transactions on source chains.
   - Requires users to trust the paymaster/solver for these operations.

3. **Use Cases**
   - Suitable for scenarios where a centralized setup is permissible.
   - Ideal for demonstrating user experience without focusing on robust infrastructure.

4. **Limitations**
   - Not designed for decentralized or trustless environments.
   - May not incorporate best practices for production-level infrastructure.

5. **Purpose**
   - Showcases the functionality and user experience of the enclave-smart-balance system.
   - Serves as a proof of concept or demonstration model.

## Implementation Notes

This version prioritizes simplicity and ease of demonstration over decentralization and trustlessness. It is best suited for controlled environments or early-stage proofs of concept where the focus is on illustrating the potential user experience and core functionality of the system.
